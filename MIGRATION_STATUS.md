# 🚀 Academic Programs Migration Status

## Current Status: Ready for Manual Migration

### ✅ Completed Steps:
1. **Schema Analysis** - Confirmed database schema mismatch
2. **Migration SQL Prepared** - Created `016_fix_academic_programs_schema.sql`
3. **Tools Created** - Built scripts for migration and verification
4. **Supabase Dashboard** - Opened at http://127.0.0.1:54321
5. **Monitoring Script** - Running to detect migration completion

### 🔄 Current Action Required:
**MANUAL STEP: Execute Migration SQL in Supabase Dashboard**

#### Instructions:
1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**: http://127.0.0.1:54321
2. **Navigate to**: SQL Editor → New Query
3. **Copy SQL from terminal output** (displayed above)
4. **Paste and click "Run"**
5. **Wait for monitoring script** to detect completion

### 📋 What the Migration Does:
- **Drops** old `academic_programs` table with incorrect schema
- **Creates** new table with correct columns:
  - `program_title` (instead of `title`)
  - `main_image` (for image URLs)
  - `full_description` (detailed content)
  - `short_description` (summary)
- **Inserts** 6 academic programs with proper data
- **Configures** RLS policies for security
- **Sets up** storage policies for `program-icons` bucket

### 🎯 Next Steps After Migration:
1. **Verify Schema** - Monitoring script will confirm success
2. **Test Admin Interface** - Check http://localhost:8080/admin/academics
3. **Test Image Upload** - Verify file upload functionality
4. **Test Image Display** - Confirm images show correctly
5. **Test Homepage** - Verify academic popups work

### 🔧 Available Tools:
- `node verify-migration.js` - Check migration success
- `node copy-migration-sql.js` - Re-display SQL if needed
- Monitoring script running in terminal 4

### 🚨 Current Issues Being Fixed:
- ❌ Database schema mismatch (`title` vs `program_title`)
- ❌ Missing columns (`main_image`, `full_description`)
- ❌ RLS policies preventing image uploads
- ❌ Admin interface using wrong column names

### ✅ Expected After Migration:
- ✅ Correct database schema
- ✅ 6 academic programs with proper data
- ✅ Working image upload/display
- ✅ Functional admin interface
- ✅ Homepage academic popups working
