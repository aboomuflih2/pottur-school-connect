## 1. Product Overview

The Academic Manager module redesign transforms the current preview-only interface into a comprehensive administrative management system with full CRUD capabilities for academic program management. This enhancement enables administrators to create, edit, delete, and manage academic programs with integrated image upload functionality and synchronized database-storage operations.

* The redesigned module addresses the need for manual administrative control over academic content, replacing static displays with dynamic management capabilities.

* Target users include school administrators and content managers who require efficient tools for maintaining academic program information and visual assets.
